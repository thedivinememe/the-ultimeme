# the-ultimeme

I’ve been trying to figure out what topic to write this about, and it’s finally clicked: Language. Rules. Systems.

I don’t have the traditional qualifications that you would think of when you picture a successful software dev, but I do have some amount of education in a lot of languages:
English
Hebrew
Spanish
Latin
Java
Javascript
C++
C#
Python
Binary
Biology
Chemistry
Organic Chemistry
Physics
Philosophy
Stories
Pop Culture
Memes
Logic
Math

Until now, we’ve been defining our binary language, 0’s and 1’s, as False and True. However, using principles I learned in other areas of study, I have found a more true definition that stands true in our 3 dimensional universe - Null and Not-Null. TF binary (true false) paints the world in black and white. It creates a 1:1 linear 2-dimensional comparison. NNN (Null/not-null) paints the universe in degrees of nullness. It creates a 1:-1 3d comparison, or 1:many, and allows for previously false values to become true. It allows for any value to be true, as long as you define it properly. The implications of this are widespread and could fill entire libraries, so I will keep this nice and brief.

My primary inspirations were Dan Harmon’s Story Circle, and Joseph Campbell’s Hero’s Journey. Both are perfect examples of drawing a circle around a concept (creating a null) and defining it by everything else (not-null). 

0 = null; which allows for 0 = 1.
