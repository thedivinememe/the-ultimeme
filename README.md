## Most recent updates: added in a paper

2/22/24 - I added in a first attempt at a paper.

I’ve been trying to figure out what topic to write this about, and it’s finally clicked: Language. Rules. Systems. Logic.

I've learned a lot of languages in my life; my qualifications don't really matter though.

Until now, we’ve been defining our binary language, 0’s and 1’s, as False and True. However, a more true definition exists in our 3 dimensional universe - Null and Not-Null. TF binary (true false) paints the world in black and white. It creates a 1:1 linear 2-dimensional comparison. NNN (Null/not-null) paints the universe in degrees of nullness. It creates a 1:-1 3d comparison, or 1:many, and allows for previously false values to become true. It allows for any value to be true, as long as you define it properly. The implications of this are widespread and could fill entire libraries, so I will keep this nice and brief.

The basis of this theory is that Nihilism is the ultimate truth (defining a null) and that choosing to believe in humanity despite that truth is the basis of what a utopian society is built on, or The Golden Rule (defining the not-null). It's been defined over and over by every faith and ideology, but because they're running on different systems and rules, they're talking different languages (1's and 0's), so they aren't able to understand that everyone wants the same thing.

Here’s another even simpler way to think of this idea: sports and not-sports. In order to define sports, you can start abstracting out everything that’s not-sports, and once you’re finished doing that, what you’re left with is “sports”. So the “null” in “null/not-null” is a variable, and in this case, “sports” is just as defined by its relationship with “not-sports” as it is “sports”; the negative values are arguably greater and more important than the positive ones.

My primary inspirations were Dan Harmon’s Story Circle, and Joseph Campbell’s Monomyth. Both are perfect examples of drawing a circle around a concept (creating a null) and defining it by everything else (not-null). In their case, they were defining "story" and "not-story".

0 = null; which allows for 0 = 1.
